# This is a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would fetch the actual content
# of the Calico manifest for the specified version and embed it here or use Helm.
# For simplicity, we are assuming the main script will handle the direct kubectl apply.
# If this template were to be used, it would contain the full YAML of the Calico operator/manifest.
